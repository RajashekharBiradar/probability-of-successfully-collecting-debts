 Using Machine Learning to forecast the probability of successfully collecting debts by analyzing statute-barred status
 In the realm of debt collection, the ability to discern which accounts are statute-barred—thus potentially unrecoverable—holds immense significance.
 This project endeavors to develop a sophisticated machine-learning model aimed at accurately predicting the probability of successfully collecting debts.
 Identify key drivers of  debts collection possibility .
 Develop predictive models to anticipate user responses.
 Statute-barred accounts can be a challenge for debt collectors, as they may be unrecoverable due to legal time limits.
In the following slides, we will take you through our project approach, methodology, data analysis plan, expected outcomes, and more.
We invite you to join us on this journey as we explore the intricate interplay of data, user behavior in the realm of driving scenarios.
Given a dataset encompassing a multitude of attributes including original creditor information, account IDs, current balances, purchase dates, and a wealth of other pertinent features...

The focal point of this endeavor centers on the 'IsStatBarred' field, which serves as the pivotal target variable for classification.
